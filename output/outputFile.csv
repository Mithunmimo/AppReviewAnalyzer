Worked great until I updated and now I can't even open it. Way to go! How long until this is fixed and we can search things?
My Samsung Tab 4 ran the previous version of Chrome just fine. I upgraded because it frequently reminded me to. Now this version frequently crashes on me. There is no option to roll back to the previous version.

"This app will not update. So I'm gonna uninstall and download a better web bro see l tellwser. Let's hope that it does automatic updates, is safe and especially reliable. Google being one of the biggest Tech Giants today, we would at least think that the app would not of been this long without being fixed. Another reason I'm uninstalling is because of the length of time I have gotten linked back to the play store to update the app that simply won't do anything you can not even open the app."

It's not update to my mobile
"Weird screen-calibration issue since latest update. If I tap near the top of a web page (e.g. Twitter's back button), Chrome acts as though I'd tapped a centimetre higher, and switches to whichever tab was above the spot I tapped. Update: also sometimes the tab bar is completely unresponsive. Previous review (still applies): This business of scrolling to ""Find in page"" results instead of skipping directly makes the function inaccessible for people with visual processing difficulties."

Still not updating
"Since switching to a Google Nest Wifi router - chrome suddenly constantly switches to ""offline"" in tabs, where it just keeps showing a cached page. I am online, and opening a new tab simply works. However, this makes the internet pretty unusable, and in some cases, much worse as incorrect (outdated) pages are shown after refresh. No way I could find to disable this feature, sadly."
I can't update my Google chrome
I use a Samsung s6 lite tablet. I can't open or change tabs in landscape mode and sometimes in portrait mode. I have to rotate the screen to do so. This is annoying and it happens randomly in both modes
"Wish I could rate it a zero. Ever since I updated all it does is send messages saying I have a virus and constant adds. Tried to delete the update, but it still keeps doing it."
Whenever I pause a video and close chrome to listen to a podcast it causes the podcast to pause constantly. This started a few weeks ago. I'm forced to close whichever tab has the video. This is really annoying because then I have to go find the video again.

Now the app freezes, locks up and is non-responsive multiple times within the hour. This is happening on my Google Pixel 2 and on my Samsung Tab S2. I will be sure NOT to upgrade the app whenever it suggests that I do so. This is why I don't allow automatic updates... This is some BS..."

"🤦🏼🤬 I don't know why I'm still trying. I feel like a fool, the donkey hitting the head on the same stone over and over again 🤦🏼🥲 Your browser is okay when it works, but I'm done with those pages getting stuck again and again, nothing works until I force stop the app and reboot it again. Very dissapointing 😔👋"

Not able to update Chrome since months.
This Google Chrome app has allowed inappropriate and unsolicited web sites to pop-up on opening. It is very offensive and have tried to block them. It is also allowing redirects without my permission therefore an ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED message occurs everything I open my phone. This web appears vpi.hfght564highjhg.tech/?t=1609 it impossible for me to block the continuous bombardment of the continued changing to other inappropriate addresses that appear. I need help to get rid of these people

"Buggy garbage. Has stupid ""swipe to change tab"" bugs, ruins browsing. On phone, has glitch screens full of pixel noise. Banned from YouTube, so they are SELF-BOYCOTTING to the tune of 65 million commenters/creators banned. GOOGLE CAN'T DIE FAST ENOUGH. FIRE SUSAN WOJACKI & HER TOXIC LEZ SJW CENSORBOT FROM RECODE. Easily outdone by the Cobalt Browser."

"Not only do I not have the option to turn off the extremely glitchy group tab feature that google support has no answers for, but I can no longer add tabs to my home screen instead of bookmarking them (sync feature doesn't work so I can't view bookmarks or full history on other devices, support doesn't have answers for that either)."
